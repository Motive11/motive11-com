/**
 * The industry versions of /partnership (/partnership/<slug>). Same offer, price, spots, and
 * terms as the general page; only the wording and the proof order change. Rendered by
 * src/components/partnership/PartnershipPage.astro via src/pages/partnership/[industry].astro.
 * Copied from the markszymanski.co repo's src/lib/industries.ts (its /work-with-me pages), November
 * 6, 2026; the two copies are not synced, so a wording change goes in both until one page retires.
 * storyOrder holds case study slugs, which match markszymanski.co's success story slugs.
 *
 * Proof rule (Mark, October 28, 2026): only claim work actually done. One law firm is one law firm,
 * and the FAQ says so. Testimonial excerpts must be verbatim trims of the published quote.
